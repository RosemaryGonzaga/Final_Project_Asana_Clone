## Why Shavasana?


Shavasana exists to make it easier for teams to collaborate on projects. Users can organize a project's tasks into stages and keep a pulse on the project's overall completion status.

## Shavasana's technology stack

This application is built on a stack of backend technologies, including PostgreSQL to host the database, Ruby on Rails for managing the data model, JQuery (AJAX), Javascript, React, Redux, HTML, and CSS.

## Feature Spotlight: User Authentication

Shavasana incorporates robust user authentication, ensuring users can only view their own team's projects and tasks.

## Feature Spotlight: Projects

Shavasana's users are able to create projects with individual tasks that they can mark complete.
